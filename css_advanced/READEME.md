This project recreates a Figma design using HTML and advanced CSS.

What you must do

Duplicate the Figma file to your Drafts.

Download all assets and place them inside an images/ folder.

Build the layout exactly as shown in Figma.

You may add any non‑positioning CSS (colors, fonts, borders, backgrounds, etc.).

Keep the general structure and positioning consistent with the design.

Fonts

Use the fonts specified in the Figma file. If a font is missing, link a webfont alternative.
